## Section 2 QA notes

### Comments

- I would suggest introducing a check for each mutate.
- Not sure why you duplicate variables before making a table? You could just use a pipe.
- I prefer using filter instead of square brackets when subsetting - it's more compatible with pipes if you're using tidyverse
- It doesn't look like scale_y_continuous in working in the first graph


### Errors

- Error in line 104 - should be Sole trader
